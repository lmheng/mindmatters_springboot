# mindmatters_springboot

This is the Springboot portion of our ADProject application Mind Matters (part 2/3)

There is a mix of RESTful APIs as well as Web views built in Springboot as we are using a mix of both in our Android application in our attempt to offer a better user interface / user experience.

# mindmatters_springboot

This is the Springboot portion of our ADProject application Mind Matters (part 2 out of 3)

There is a mix of RESTful APIs as well as Web views built in Springboot as we are using a mix of both in our Android application in our attempt to offer a better user interface / user experience.

To run this, ensure that the Python Flask Server is running and link this up with the Android component (part 3/3) to experience the full application.
